# Welcome to my website ðŸ‘‹

I am a fourth-year BS-MS student in the department of Physics at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Bhopal.

My academic interests include optics and photonics, quantum physics, and astronomy. Iâ€™m particularly excited by the experimental and theoretical techniques used to study light and the universe.
